      <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
      <p>
        After inquiring about how I could contribute to the research done at SURF (Systems Utilization 
        Research for) Stanford Medicine (Dr. David Scheinker's lab), I got involved with their project
        seeking to develop a simulation model to support capacity management and patient flow decision-making 
        by hospital stakeholders. I collaborated with a team of grad students,  implementing 
        improvements to the backend of the model, while also designing validation and performance metrics
        to assess the overall performance of the model as well as the effectiveness of the changes we'd test 
        out.
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary focus was on improving the patient sampling mechanism. Through interviews with various 
        hospital stakeholders, I learned more about how to modify our sampling logic to better mirror
        the institution's actual policies, which resulted in improvements in simulation accuracy from 94% 
        to 98%. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, the team was also interested in exploring how the model would fare using data from a different
        institution. I was hired by Robert Wood Johnson Barnabas Healthcare as a Private Consultant and Software
        Engineer, spending the summer exploring how the model could be adapted to their policies and needs. 
        After extensive research and interviews, I identified key differences between the patient flow and overall
        procedures at the two institutions and began exploring how to modularize SWIM in order to be quickly adapted
        to the needs of other institutions such as RWJBH. I also conducted analyses on their patient census and 
        transfer data, presenting recommendations to their board on how to divide 96 beds made available by the 
        opening of a new facility.
