      <p>
        In this market design course, a large part of our final grade was dependent on 
        the investigation/implementation of a solution to a market design problem of our
        choosing. My friend Gavin McDonell and I were aware of the current suboptimal process used by
        Stanford's Mathematics department in determining how to pair grad student mentors
        with undergrad participants for the Directed Reading Program. As of right now, the
        DRP committee (4 Math PhD students) pore through applications by hand, a tedious
        and time-consuming process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our proposed solution, grounded in extensive literature review, was to formulate
        weights between any potential mentor-mentee pair in order to solve for the 
        max weight bipartite matching. By changing the application process to create 
        applicant/mentor profiles leveraging qualities that are key indicators of
        high quality mentorship while weighting the importance of these qualities by 
        applicant personal preference, we were able to demonstrate a significant improvement 
        in average match quality, which can significantly contribute to program success in 
        fostering greater involvement with mathematics in academia.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was responsible for designing and implementing the simulation we used to demonstrate 
        these results. In the process, I not only learned how to use networkx to model bipartite 
        graphs in Python, but I also had to leverage asynchronous parallelization to allow us to 
        simulate a large quantity of applicant pools and potential matches in order to increase 
        our confidence in our results. The final report below explores in more detail the mathematical 
        and theoretical considerations that went into our design, such as an investigation of the 
        level of strategy-proofness we might observe with such a system.
