      <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
      <p>
        Stanford's CS 221: AI Principles and Techniques course has an optional final project component, where 
        students are provided the opportunity to work directly with a Course Assistant mentor on a project 
        of their choosing. With a few of my friends who share my interest in tech entrepreneurship, we decided 
        to apply key concepts from the ML unit to investigate whether it'd be possible to predict the success of
        a startup based on some of its features. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After finding a dataset on Kaggle (linked below), we had to make some decisions regarding feature 
        selection, which informed we processed and formatted the raw data to prepare it for analysis. These decisions
        are detailed in our final report below. Then, we used sk-learn to train a logistic regression model to
        serve as our baseline, which we compared to a variety of configurations of small neural networks 
        developed using PyTorch. We experimented with an assortment of combinations for hyperparameters such as 
        learning rate, hidden layer depth, hidden layer width, and batch size, to examine their effect on overall 
        performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        After testing over 60 different initial hyperparameter configurations and examining accuracies ranging from
        20% to over 80%, we observed the best performance with a learning rate of 0.1, batch size of 32, and 2 
        hidden layers with 5 and 4 nodes respectively, yielding 86.21% accuracy. More detailed discussion of our
        results can be found in the final report below. Overall, as an optional final project completed in
        somewhat of a rush and our first time working with PyTorch, this project served as an excellent learning 
        opportunity regarding the importance of design choices at every step of the machine learning pipeline, be
        it data engineering all the way to hyperparameter tuning.
